Emacs Customization
===================

Benoit Leveau's emacs customization files.
https://github.com/big--ben/emacs_config

Motivation
----------

I want to:
- store my emacs configuration files in one place (don't want to end up with different versions, don't want to carry them on usb, etc.)
- have them on source control management so I can have branches, history, etc.
- support linux and windows
- be able to set different settings for each place I'm using the configuration (username, email, company name for copyright notices in files, etc.)
- be able to add some custom files to define place-specific macros (MPC's oi, etc.)

Result
------

I achieved pretty much everything I listed above.
A better setup system is in progress. Right now, it prompts the user for all options and then write the corresponding setup to a file, for future sessions.

Installing
----------

Steps:
- clone the git repository into ~/emacs_includes
- do a symlink from ~/.emacs to ~/emacs_includes/.emacs
- restart emacs

Customization
-------------

The first time emacs launches, you'll be asked to enter some settings. These options are then
written to emacs_include/user_setup_options.mel which will be loaded in the next sessions.
You can reset the options by deleting this file. You can also edit it for quick changes.

Also, after all the configuration is initialized, the emacs_include/user_configuration.el file
is sourced if present. It's not part of git and is ignored by git, so users can put whatever they
want inside.

TODO
----
It would be good to be able to provide another file with the shortcut folders, as it won't be
practical to have prompt for this kind of settings.
