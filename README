Emacs Customization
===================

Benoit Leveau's emacs customization files.

Interest
--------

I want to:
- store the files centrally
- having them on source control management so I don't end up with different versions at home or at work
- easier to put them online than to carry the files in a USB key.

Installing
----------

Steps:
- clone the git repository into ~/emacs_includes
- do a symlink from ~/.emacs to ~/emacs_includes/.emacs
- restart emacs

Current status
--------------

The current configuration is still very tied to my computer names, etc.
I need to add a way to customize it by having an external configuration file containing:
- user name
- email address
- for shortcut_folders, a list of (keyword, path) pairs
I also need to add code that sources a user custom file if present, so that anyone can add his own
customizations without interfering with the repository.
